                    <p>Currently, COVID-19 has become a global scale threat to our health. Meanwhile, the situation in
                        some
                        regions such as China and Singapore has more or less become stable. To help everyone to be more
                        aware of the global situation, and even hopefully contribute our possibly 3 cents to the
                        intervention of this epidemics, we here calculated the time-varying reproduction number from
                        time
                        series of case numbers in each region on which we can get data and share it on this website. We
                        will
                        update daily when possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>The basic reproduction number <img src="./static/eq_en/eq.latex">, which means roughly the number
                        of new
                        individuals will be infected on average by a single infector when there is no intervention at
                        all,
                        and the corresponding time-varying reproduction number <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> at
                        time <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(2).latex"> with possibly some interventions, are two important
                        indicators of
                        how severe is the epidemics and how effective are the interventions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here, we will provide first a time series of <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> for each
                        region on
                        which we get data, and we will also show some predictive results based on very simple and rough
                        extensions, which will be explained in the following.

                    <p>While working on analysis of COVID-19 data, we note that the effective time-varing reproduction

                        one of
                        local cases (<img src="./static/eq_en/eq(4).latex">) due to the different intervention policy for
                        imported

                    <p>Also, the test version of the modified EpiEstim has been provided at Github, and the manuscript

                        this new calculation will soon be posted on an arXiv website.

                    <p>With the calculated <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex">, we constructed two simple and rough
                        scenarios
                        to make some prediction,
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Null Scenario: extend the <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> of a region of interest by
                            taking
                            <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(10).latex">, where <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(11).latex"> is the
                            latest time of
                            the known <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex">, that is to say just take the latest value
                            to be the
                            future value of the time-varying reproduction number of a region of interest,</li>
                        <li> Typical-Region Scenario: Extend the <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> of a region of
                            interest by
                            connecting to it the <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(12).latex"> of a chosen typical region,
                            which we use
                            China (cn) and Singapore (sg).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><img src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> of the two typical regions are decreasing functions since
                        there is
                        no data at the very beginning, and when there are data, usually there are interventions already.
                    </p>
                    <p>When we connect for example <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(13).latex"> to <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(1).latex"> of
                        a region of interest, we might encouter three cases. Firstly, if the latest value <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(14).latex"> is smaller than some values but at all values of <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(13).latex">, we find the place <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(15).latex">
                        such that <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(16).latex"> and then let <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(17).latex">. Secondly, if the
                        latest value <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(14).latex"> is larger than all values of <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(13).latex">, we left extrapolate <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(13).latex"> (for example
                        using the splinefun R function) so that we will find a large enough value such that <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(16).latex"> (here <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(15).latex">) and then
                        again we let <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(17).latex">. Lastly, in principle, there is a case where
                        <img src="./static/eq_en/eq(14).latex"> is smaller than all <img
                            src="./static/eq_en/eq(13).latex">, but we have
                        not see such a cases in real data.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Null Scenario is like to ask that if nothing changes what will happen, while the
                        Typical-Region
                        Scenario is to ask when will happen if the region of interest learn from the typical regions and
                        those learned interventions are exactly as effective as they were in the original region.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are some limitations of the method. First, the scenarios are too simple to be realistic.
                        Second, in many other regions, due to data limitations, we have not distinguished the zeroth,
                        first,
                        second and beyond generations of cases. The method is currently applied to a single-region
                        model,
                        where all the other regions are treated as exogenous variables. In principle, the method is
                        readily
                        applicable to a multi-region situation, where flows among the regions can be estimated via
                        traffic
                        data.
